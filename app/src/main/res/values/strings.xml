        Corallium was invited to be part of YCIS\'s Open Day, where we had a booth on the ground floor. We sold homemade coral-themed cookies that were made by the team, and we also had a minigame about tank maintenance.

    <string name="open_day_text_two">
        We sold out all 200 of our cookies in just under 2 hours, and almost every single customer played the minigame as well, and some even followed our Instagram @coralliumhk.
